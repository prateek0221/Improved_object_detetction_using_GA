<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>his research presents a transfer learning approach that utilizes a genetic algorithm to address the challenges associated with conventional transfer learning
  in deep learning-based object detection models. The proposed method was applied to the Yolov5s pre-trained on the COCO dataset.</p>

  <h2>Guide to run the model</h2>
  <li>Clone the repository.</li>
  <li>open the location of folder src code (from the local drive) : 'cd ../location of src code .</li>
  <li> run terminal command : 'python detect.py --weights yolov5s.pt --source "location of the file to be used for detetction"</li>
  <li>After running the model , the results are saved in:  ' src code -> runs-> detect -> exp_"**latest file**"'</li>
  <li>**note :** video and img file are favourable for input while live stream from front cam can also be provided as input.</li>
